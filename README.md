# Dynamic-object-detection
Dynamic Object Detection for Autonomous Driving
Problem Statement:
- The challenge is to design and implement a dynamic object detection system to identify and track moving objects in a given environment. The primary application is to enhance autonomous driving capabilities by providing real-time detection of dynamic obstacles in the surroundings. The solution should be implemented in C++ and optimized for the x64 architecture.
